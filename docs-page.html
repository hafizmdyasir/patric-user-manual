						    <p>PaTriC stands for <strong>Particle Tracker in C++</strong>. It is an open-source, fully relativistic charged particle tracking code that can simulate the motion of any number of targets in specified electric and magnetic fields.</p>
							
							<p>PaTriC has been designed keeping students and researchers in mind. It utilizes the isolated particle model and thus, is suitable for generating a tractable idea of the response of systems to a given field configuration.</p>

							<p>PaTriC was developed at the Indian Institute of Technology by Mohammad Yasir under the supervision of Professor Vikrant Saxena.</p>

						<h2 class="section-heading">What PaTriC Does?</h2>
						<p>PaTriC can simulate the motion of any number of targets in specified electric and magnetic fields, following the isolated particle model. It ignores inter-particle interactions and simulates how a charged particle will move under the action of the given fields configuration. PaTriC ships with a number of pre-defined fields like magnetic coils to ease the process of setting up simulations.</p>

                        <p>PaTriC is designed to be highly flexible and easy to use, allowing users to customize every aspect of the simulation and output. When you set up the simulation, you instruct PaTriC about the time-step, the integrator, the number of particles, etc. PaTriC uses the specified integration algorithm to solve the equation of motion for the target particle using the Lorentz Force as the driving force. It then saves the variables you requested to simple, human-readable, output files.</p>

						    <p>PaTriC does not ship in the form of executable binaries. Instead, you must download the source code and compile it on your system. Owing to certain features utilizing Unix-specific headers, PaTriC is only available on Unix operating systems. In this section, you will find everything you need to know about downloading, installing, and getting started with PaTriC.</p>

						<h2 class="section-heading">Code Structure</h2>
						<p>PaTriC is primarily written in C++ but there are minor pieces of the code that utilize Python. To setup a simulation, you create an input script; a file that tells PaTriC all it needs to know about the simulation. This file is passed to the patric executable as the first argument. Once an input script is ready, you can run PaTriC by using the terminal command <code>patric path/to/input.py</code></p>

						<p>This input file is written in Python and contains the following information:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Essential information about the simulation like time-step, number of iterations, etc.</li>
							<li>Information about your target particle like charge, mass, initial conditions, etc.</li>
							<li>Information about the electric and magnetic fields.</li>
							<li>Information about the program output.</li>
						</ol>
					</section><!--//section-->

					<section class="docs-section" id="item-2-2">
						<h2 class="section-heading">Prerequisites</h2>
						<p>To get started, you will need the following:
						<ol>
							<li>A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)</li>
							<li>Python 3.x</li>
							<li>The <code>pypatric</code> package. Get it via any package manager of your choice using the package name <code>codecat_pypatric</code>.</li>
						</ol></p>

						<p>Furthermore, it is assumed that you have, at the very least, a basic understanding of how simulations work, python programming, and some knowledge about the terminal in the linux operating system.</p>

					<section class="docs-section" id="item-2-3">
						<h2 class="section-heading">Download & Install</h2>
						<p>You can grab the latest version of PaTriC from its GitHub releases page. Use the big green button in the top-right corner to get there. The release is provided as a zipped archive. When you extract it, you will end up with a folder named PaTriC whose structure is as follows:</p>

						<div class="docs-code-block">
							<pre class="shadow-lg rounded"><code style="background: none;">	| PaTriC

						<p>All you need to worry about here is the <code>compile.sh</code>script. It will take care of everything for you. Fire up a terminal in the extracted PaTriC folder and make this script executable using the command <br/>
							<code>$ chmod +x ./compile.sh</code>.<br/></p>

						<p>Now, run this script using the command <code>./compile.sh</code> and follow the on-screen instructions. If all goes well, you will find an executable named patric in the <code>runtime</code> folder. Add this folder to your system path and you're ready to go.</p>

							<p>As stated before, the input script for PaTriC is written in Python, and the path to this script is passed to the PaTriC executable as the first argument. The program then parses it and displays the parsed information before asking whether to proceed. This is a good point to recheck whether you have provided all parameters correctly or not.</p>

					<section class="docs-section" id="item-4-1">
					<h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>
						<p>The input script consists of four python <code>dict</code> objects named <code>Control</code>, <code>Particle</code>, <code>Fields</code>, and <code>Output</code>. Each of these dictionaries serves a specific purpose and contains key-value pairs where the keys are special keywords defined inside the PaTriC source code.</p>

						<p>Since it is understandbly difficult to remember, recall, and type the keywords each time you set up a simulation, we have created a package called <code>pypatric</code> that makes your job easier. This package also validates your parameters to ensure nothing unexpected happens during program execution. </p>

						<p>The four dictionaries are defined using four functions from the <code>pypatric.deck_helper</code> module. Thus, every time you want to setup a simulation, start by creating a python file and importing everything from this module.</p>
					</section><!--//section-->
					
					<section class="docs-section" id="item-4-2">
						<h2 class="section-heading">The Control Dict</h2>
						<p>The purpose of the <code>Control</code> dictionary is to inform PaTriC about the control of the simulation. This includes the time-step for each iteration, the number of iterations before the program stops, the integration algorithm, and an optional message display frequency.</p>

						<p>The calling signature for the function to define the Control dictionary is <code>createControl(timeStep: float, numiterations: int, integrator: int, readoutFreq: int)</code>.</p>

						<h3>Time Step</h3>
						<p>In each iteration of the program, the particle advances by a time-step $dt$ across its trajectory in the phase space. This value is passed as the first argument to the <code>createControl</code> function.</p>
						
						<p>The choice of the time-step depends on the user and the system being studied. There is no fixed formula that will give the best results. Typically, finer step-sizes give more accurate results, but require a large number of iterations, which increases computation time and memory consumption. Further, the choice of the integrator also affects the accuracy of the output.</p>

						<p>For most cases, we recommend a step-size of at least $T/10$, where $T$ is the time-period of the fastest process in the system. For increased accuracy, one can use $T/20$, $T/50$, or even $T/100, but the latter is overkill.</p>

						<h3>Number of Iterations</h3>
						<p>This is passed as the second argument and defines how many steps the program will run for. Any process with a characteristic time $T$ will require at least $T/dt$ iterations to be fully resolved once. Typically, you should run the program for at least $5$ times the time period of the slowest process in the system.</p>

						<h3>Integrator</h3>
						<p>PaTriC has support for three explicit, second-order integration algorithms. These are the Boris push, the Vay integrator, and the Higuera-Cary push. Use predefined keywords <code>BORIS</code>, <code>VAY</code>, and <code>HIGUERA_CARY</code> to choose which integrator you need.</p>

						<p>The performance of each of these integrators has been well-studied before and the Boris push usually suffices. The Vay integrator comes at a higher computation cost but can yield better cross-field drifts, while the Higuera-Cary integrator has the best phase performance.</p>

						<h3>Stdout Frequency</h3>
						<p>You can instruct PaTriC to display a short message every n iterations. n is passed as the fourth argument to the function and can be 0 if you want to disable this functionality. This does not affect the performance or accuracy of the simulation.</p>
					</section><!--//section-->
					
					<section class="docs-section" id="item-4-3">
						<h2 class="section-heading">The Particle Dict</h2>
						<p>The Particle dictionary is where you define the target of your simulation. PaTriC provides the functionality to simulate a large number of charged particles in succession, each with a given initial condition. This is useful for studying, say, a distribution of particles in a given configuration. Note that regardless of how many particles you simulate, they will be studied separately and remain uninfluenced by each other. </p>

						<p>The Particle dictionary is created using the signature <code>createParticles(mass: float, charge: float, particleCount: int, initialPosition: Tuple, initialVelocity: Tuple)</code>. The charge and mass are assigned commonly to each of the particles, while the initial positions and velocities can either be assigned separately, or drawn from a uniform distribution, or generated randomly.</p>

						<h3>Number of Particles</h3>
						<p>This is an integer parameter and is limited only by the configuration of your machine. It is theoretically possible to study as many as 10<sup>6</sup> particles, but that is an unrealistic number.</p>

						<h3>The Charge and Mass of the Particles</h3>
						<p>The charge is provided in units of the fundamental charge, $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}\ C$. It can be any signed floating point number. The same charge is assigned to all the particles in the simulation.</p>

						<p>Mass is provided in units of the mass of electron $m_e = 9.1 \times 10^{-31}\ kg$. It is also given to all the particles. This quantity must be a positive float.</p>

						<h3>Initial Position</h3>
						<p>The initial position argument <strong>must</strong> be provided as a python <code>tuple</code>. You may either provide a separate initial position for each of the particles using the <code>Static</code> class defined in <code>pypatric.classes</code> module, or draw it uniformly between a given range using <code>Uniform</code>, or generate randomly using <code>Random</code>. The explanation for each of these classes is given in the section that explains the <code>pypatric</code> module. </p>

						<h3>Initial Velocity</h3>
						<p>The initial velocity is also provided as a tuple containing either <code>Static</code> type objects, or a single <code>Uniform</code> or <code>Maxwellian</code> object. The former gives uniformly distributed velocities between the given range, while the latter samples from a Maxwellian distribution centered at 0 with FWHM given by the temperature provided as an argument.</p>

                                <p>In python, tuples are typically defined using a pair of parantheses <code>()</code>. However, when you request <code>Uniform</code> or <code>Random</code> or <code>Maxwellian</code> placement, there will be only a single item in the tuple. In such a case, the code <code>(Maxwellian(temp))</code> will be considered the same as <code>Maxwellian(temp)</code>, i.e., the tuple won't be created. To get around this, always place a guard empty element in the tuple.<br/>
								Use <code>(Maxwellian(temp), )</code>. </p>

						<p>This is the part where you define the electric and magnetic fields that will be used to evolve the system. The syntax is fairly simple. Call the function <code>createFields(electricFields: Tuple | Callable, magneticFields: Tuple | Callable)</code>.</p>

						<p>The tuple must contain either a number of objects of pre-defined classes (see <a href="pypatric.html#section-4">PyPaTriC - Classes</a>), or a function named <code>getEField</code> or <code>getBField</code> taking the arguments <code>x,y,z,t</code>, and returning the three components of the electric and magnetic fields as a tuple.</p>
						
						<p>In the former case, the value of the field will be a superposition of the values calculated by each of the objects passed to the tuple. In the latter case, the tuple must only contain one entry: the function with the signature as stated just now. A python interpreter will be used to call this function at each iteration.

						<h2 class="section-heading">The Output Dict</h2>
						<p>The function of the Output dictionary is to inform PaTriC how to dump the data from the simulation. This includes the file name for output, the file path, any optional data you want to put in the info file, and the variables to dump.</p>

						<p>The Output dictionary is created using the syntax <code>createOutput(fileName: str, filePath: str, fileHeaders: Tuple[str, ...], dumpInfoFile: bool, dumpVariables: Tuple[str, ...])</code>. A description is as follows:</p>

						<h3>File Name and Path</h3>
						<p>The <code>fileName</code> argument is a string representing the name of the output file. It should not include any extension. PaTriC will automatically assign <code>.dat</code> extension to the output files. The <code>filePath</code> argument is a string representing the directory path where the output file will be saved. If the directory does not exist, it will be created automatically.</p>

						<h3>fileHeaders Argument</h3>
						This is a tuple of strings that will be written to an info file dumped alongside the output files, containing basic information about the simulation run. Note that regardless of the number of particles, only a single info file is created and it has the same name as provided via <code>fileName</code>.

						<h3>dumpInfoFile Flag</h3>
						<p>If you want, you can disable the creation of the info file by passing <code>False</code> to this parameter. The default value is <code>True</code> and thus, info file will be created by default.</p>

						<h3>dumpVariables Argument</h3>
						<p>This is a tuple of strings that lists the variables you want to dump. Supported values inside this tuple are as follows:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><code>POS_(X,Y,Z)</code>: The (x,y,z)-component of position.</li>

							<li><code>VEL_(X,Y,Z)</code>: The (x,y,z)-component of velocity.</li>

							<li><code>E_FIELD_(X,Y,Z)</code>: The (x,y,z)-component of the electric field calculated at each time instant.</li>

							<li><code>B_FIELD_(X,Y,Z)</code>: The (x,y,z)-component of the magnetic field calculated at each time instant</li>

							<li><code>GAMMA</code>: The relativistic factor $\gamma$ at each time instant.</li>

						    <p>Now that we have gone through all there is to know about the input scripts, and assuming that you have gone through the <a href="pypatric.html">pypatric user manual</a>, we are now ready to run PaTriC using an example script it ships with.

						<h2 class="section-heading">Cross Field Drift</h2>
						<p>When a charged particle is placed in perpendicular electric and magnetic fields, it gyrates along the magnetic field line, and also experiences a drift in the direction perpendicular to that of the electric and magnetic fields. The magnitude of this drift is given as $|\vec{v}_D| = |\vec{E}|/|\vec{B}|$.</p>

						<p>We are going to simulate this field in an electric field of 100 V/m and electric field of 1 Gauss. In such a field, a particle with $v_\perp$ will gyrate with a time period of $45.4\ \mu s$. We resolve this with $dt=T/220$. The input script is given below:</p>

						<h2 class="section-heading">Basic Questions</h2>
						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>Who is PaTriC for?</h5>
						<p>PaTriC is mainly for students and early entrants into the world of plasma simulation. It can aid in visualizing how charged particles respond to various types of electric and magnetic fields.</p>

						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>What is the scope of application of PaTriC?</h5>
						<p>While PaTriC was developed keeping plasma simulations in mind, there is theoretically nothing stopping the user from specifying specific forms of electric fields. This means that you can essentially simulate <i>anything</i> related to the motion of a particle.</p>

						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>Can PaTriC be used for professional research?</h5>
						<p>It depends on the problem at hand. Full description of plasma systems naturally requires far more information than PaTriC can provide. But the study of numerical integrators, their accuracy, single particle responses, etc. can easily be studied.</p>

						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>What are the system requirements?</h5>
						<p>PaTriC is available for unix based operating systems like ubuntu. Since it uses the single particle model, the system requirements aren't that high and most mid-end machines can comfortably run PaTriC.</p>

						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>How can I support PaTriC?</h5>
						<p>If you want to donate to this open-source project, visit <a href="paypal.me/hafizmdyasir">this page</a>. <br/>
						
						If you want to contribute to the development, stay tuned as we will be releasing a developer's guide soon.

						<h2 class="section-heading">Physics Questions</h2>
						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>What types of fields can I specify?</h5>
						<p>A few special types of fields can be defined using inbuilt classes and objects (take a look at the pypatric documentation at <a href="pypatric.html">this link</a>). <br/>
						
						For specifying other types of fields, you can create a python function in the input script and from thereon, sky is the limit?</p>

						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>Can I specify lasers?</h5>
						<p>While there isn't inbuilt support for specifying a laser, you can easily simulate it using custom python functions that correctly apply the electric and magnetic fields.</p>

						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>What happens if the particle is non-relativistic?</h5>
						<p>PaTriC does not distinguish between relativistic and non-relativistic particles. However, since the relativistic factor $\gamma$ approaches unity in this case, the underlying physics is always accurate.</p>

							<h2 class="section-heading">Common Errors</h2>
						    <h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle me-1"></i>ModuleNotFoundError</h5>
							<p>This error most likely originates because you haven't installed the <code>codecat_pypatric</code> module that is necessary for PaTriC to function.</p>

							<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle me-1"></i>The output file contains <code>nan</code></h5>
							<p>This is most likely due to incorrect mathematics. It could originate out of a number of reasons including but not limited to:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The particle goes super-luminous ($v\geq c$). C++ returns <code>nan</code> if the square root argument is negative.</li>
								<li>The initial conditions aren't properly specified. This can lead to the program reading nan as the input and taking it from there.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle me-1"></i>Program throws error codes between 101 to 104</h5>
							<p>These errors originate out of the input script. You will most likely get a message with these error codes that explains what went wrong.</p>
							
							<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle me-1"></i>Other Error Codes</h5>
							<ul>
								<li>$808$: No configuration file was specified.</li>
								<li>$202$: The python scripts could not be located. Have you deleted any files? Try reinstalling the program.</li>
								<li>$404$: Could not locate the configuration file specified. Have you provided the correct name and path?</li>
								<li>$-1$: The input script was badly designed and could not be parsed.</li>
								<li>$+1$: Unspecified error. Contact the developers.</li>
